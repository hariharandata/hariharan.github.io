## 💼 Professional Experience

### Data Engineer 
**Volvo Cars, Sweden** (Consultant via Nexer AB until Dec 2023)

*Sep 2022 – Present*
- Built automated data pipelines for AD/ADAS systems using a combination of Apache Airflow, Jenkins, and REST APIs, ensuring scalable and modular architecture for continuous vehicle data ingestion.
- Architected message-driven workflows that listen for new data events, triggering pipeline execution dynamically via API calls and Jenkins jobs, improving response times and reducing manual involvement.
- Developed a secure, user-friendly Flask web application enabling manual triggering and monitoring of data pipelines with role-based access and built-in logging for auditability.
- Simulated sensor environments (Radar, Lidar, USS) by building SQL-driven pipelines that mimic real-world scenarios, facilitating effective testing of autonomous functionalities.
- Created visualization dashboards using Grafana and Matplotlib to monitor sensor performance, enabling quick diagnostics and faster debugging in simulation loops.
- Built a robust Python-based integration for a third-party quality API to automate tagging, metadata syncing, and error tracking — significantly improving data reliability.
- Automated vehicle signal decoding pipelines using Jenkins, making the process completely event-driven and hands-free, resulting in improved data freshness and reduced human error.
- Collaborated with cross-functional teams, including data scientists, software developers, and cloud infrastructure teams using Agile methodologies (Scrum, Jira).
